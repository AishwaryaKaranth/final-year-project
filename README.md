# Morphological Taxonomy of Galaxies using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project is based on the [Galaxy Zoo Challenge by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge). 
We obtained the dataset from Kaggle. We used VGG16 architecture to classify the galaxies into 37 different categories.
