## Abstract
- The Universe has billions of galaxies and studying the morphology of the galaxies gives insights into answers to fundamental questions such as the origin of the Universe. We have surveyed 20 papers that have used various machine learning and deep learning approaches to automate the classification of these galaxies to gather insights into the accuracy that is obtained by these approaches. We observe that the deep learning approach yielded a more accurate result compared to the machine learning approach. (Aishwarya)

- Scientists build a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies by classifying them into different categories based on morphological parameters. In this paper, we present a survey of 20 research efforts that employ various machine learning and deep learning techniques for the classification of galaxies based on morphology. The pre-processing methods used on the data, models employed and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics used at each work under study are examined in this paper. (Aditi)

- To study the large-scale structure of the Universe,Morphological classification of galaxies is very important key.The main challenge here is to buid a robust methodology to perform a reliable classification fron the multiple sets of galaxies.Deep learning played a very important role in image Processing and data analysis with very good potential.The hubble sequence is the main research of interest as it allows to classify the galaxies based on their features into three main categories namely Elliptical,Spiral and irregular.Varient of ResNets(Residual Networks),Decision tree algorithm,Random forest regressor is proposed for classification. (Ameena)

- With evolving galaxies and growing galaxy image data it  was impossible for manual sorting. Automated means were then considered and newer algorithms kept on evolving for feature extraction, reduction and ultimately classifying them  Deeplearning techniques is used widely and seem to have replaced the traditional machine learning techinques.We have reviewed 20 research papers specifying various techniques of pre-processing and training .(Adhishreya)


## Introduction
- Hubble tuning fork included nearly five categories, the elliptical,bars,irregular lenticular and spiral types. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ,is one of the prominent sky surveys and comprises of deep, multi-color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and created 3-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000 galaxies and more than 120,000 quasars.[13]Galaxy Zoo2 project involved a crowdsourcing effort via a web based platform to classify the galaxies as per a catalogue containing 11 questions and 37 different possible responses in all .[11] eliminated certain questions from the catalogue such as number and tightness of spiral arms. [12].Self supervised technique that works on unlabelled data with certain attributes that can be derived from the images.[11]Deep Learning is said to extract the most relevant features automatically using non-linear transformations.

- 13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang led to the creation of the universe that we know today, comprising of billions of galaxies of sundry sizes and shapes. Galaxies are gravitationally bound collections of interstellar dust, gas and stars and these mysterious creations are a fundamental topic in cosmology. Galaxies exhibit a plethora of different morphologies and knowledge of the same aids astrophysicists to test existing theories pertaining to the nature of the universe and construct conjectures of their own. Previously, astronomers would use manual techniques for the purpose of classification of galaxies but with the advent of epochal fields like Machine learning and Deep learning, this process has since been automated, which not only greatly reduces the time consumed but also prevents misclassifications and inaccuracies that are inevitable in manual methods. There has been an explosion in the astronomical data available in recent times and the manual analysis of the same is not feasible. Morphological classification of galaxies is the process of categorising galaxies based on their visual shapes. The work surveyed in this paper exhibits different styles of classification. In [1], there was a three-category classification - Elliptical, Spiral and Irregular. In [2], they attempted a five-category classification - spiral, elliptical, round, disk and other. In [3], they tried a three-category classification - elliptical, spiral and irregular initially and then did a 7-category classification based on the Hubble scheme. Another attempt [4] made use of the Galaxy Decision Tree (Willett et al., 2013) in which there are 11 questions and they have to predict the probabilities of 37 answers. In [5], they discuss the importance of Shape descriptors that could be useful indicators in classifying galaxies. The motivation for presenting this survey stems from the need to find the most optimal, efficient and accurate existing method for the classification of galaxies based on morphology. (Aditi)      


- Now a days Astronomy has become a data rich Field of knowledge with the evolvement of new technologies in recent decades.Morphology mainly reveals the environmental and structural properties.studying important types and properties of galaxies reveals the origin and more clues
regarding the development of Universe.Galaxy Classification based on morphology is a system which is used to divide the galaxies based on their visual appearance.
This sysytem also helps the astrophysicits to face the challenges caused by consumption of time because of the huge amounts of the database.
This process of classification serves as long term goal for astrophysicits.
So several Machine Learning and Deep Learning approches are used to Improve this Classification Task.
In [6],The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data set was used here. Here an neural network architecture for galaxies classification is presented.
The categories of galaxies in the classificaton task were Elliptical,Spiral and Irregular.For Feature Extraction convolutional layer was proposed and A robust deep convolutional neural network architecture for the galaxy morphology classification was developed.
In [7],In this paper mainly two distinct approaches for galaxy morphology Classification are proposed - one based on non-parametric morphology 
and traditional machine learning algorithms and another based on Deep Learning.Decision trees and their variations, CART, SVM and Multilayer Perceptron models were used to perform three class 
classification(spiral,elleptical,barred spiral).In [8],A robust deep convolutional neural network architecture for galaxy morphology classification is presented. 
The categories for the classification of galaxies based on the morphological features are Elleptical,Spiral,Irreuglar.	
In [9],A variant of residual networks (ResNets) for galaxy morphology classification was proposed here. The dataset was used from galaxy Zoo dataset. The categories of galaxies in the classificaton task were 5 classes namely completely round smooth, in-between smooth, cigar-shaped smooth, edge-on and spiral.
In [10],In this paper Decision trees and Random Forest are used. Random Forest gave the highest percentages.Reliable models were used here to distinguish between spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies or star/unknown galactic objects.(Ameena)					


## Methodology
### Dataset
- In this subsection, we introduce the sources of data made use of in all the related works surveyed. There are numerous large datasets available containing thousands of images of galaxies. Most of the  datasets contain galaxies imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In [1], an attempt was made to manually collected their images from Google using a browser extension called Fatkun Batch Image Download which led them to do a significant amount of preprocessing, discussed in the following subsection. Some of this preprocessing could be avoided by using datasets like the one by Galaxy Zoo. The current Galaxy Zoo combines images from the SDSS with the most distant images yet from Hubble's CANDELS project. The GZ data has fueled multiple papers. The GZ data comes with 61578 pre-classified 424 × 424 RGB images of galaxies taken from SDSS. It also comes with the classifications that have been collected from a crowdsourced quiz which are given in the form of probabilities of the answers to 37 questions. This dataset was used in [2] and [4]. In [3], a dataset obtained from Zsolt Frei’s galaxy catalogue was used. Hubble Tuning Fork images were used as model or prototype images in [5]. (Aditi)
- Galaxy Zoo 2 Catalogue, includes morphological information about galaxies, annotated by volunteers by imposing a series of questions[13],[11](for training).Datasets derived from Catalog Archieve Server of SDSS(sloan Digital Sky Survey) where the image size was 120x120 px. An approximate of 2,45,609 images were used[13]. Zsolt frei Catalog comprises of nearly 113 images from nearby galaxies taken in multiple pass bands the images had high resolution and had better calibrations therefore extensive pre-processing was not required[14].Nair et al. 2010 catalogue[11] (for training).For testing the catalogues used were Huertas-Company et al. 2011 catalogue, Cheng et al. 2011[11]
Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) is an imaging survey that covers the southern sky, it uses 12 optical bands. [12] uses the first release of the S-PLUS which includes both images and catalogues of detected objects.
