## Abstract
- The Universe has billions of galaxies and studying the morphology of the galaxies gives insights into answers to fundamental questions such as the origin of the Universe. We have surveyed 20 papers that have used various machine learning and deep learning approaches to automate the classification of these galaxies to gather insights into the accuracy that is obtained by these approaches. We observe that the deep learning approach yielded a more accurate result compared to the machine learning approach. (Aishwarya)

- Scientists build a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies by classifying them into different categories based on morphological parameters. In this paper, we present a survey of 20 research efforts that employ various machine learning and deep learning techniques for the classification of galaxies based on morphology. The pre-processing methods used on the data, models employed and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics used at each work under study are examined in this paper. (Aditi)

- To study the large-scale structure of the Universe,Morphological classification of galaxies is very important key.The main challenge here is to buid a robust methodology to perform a reliable classification fron the multiple sets of galaxies.Deep learning played a very important role in image Processing and data analysis with very good potential.The hubble sequence is the main research of interest as it allows to classify the galaxies based on their features into three main categories namely Elliptical,Spiral and irregular.Varient of ResNets(Residual Networks),Decision tree algorithm,Random forest regressor is proposed for classification.Different popular convolutional neural networks are applied to sample of thousands of images from different datasets to classsify the galaxies.Deep learning approach achieved significant results for the powerful shape detection system. (Ameena)

- With evolving galaxies and growing galaxy image data it  was impossible for manual sorting. Automated means were then considered and newer algorithms kept on evolving for feature extraction, reduction and ultimately classifying them  Deeplearning techniques is used widely and seem to have replaced the traditional machine learning techinques.We have reviewed 20 research papers specifying various techniques of pre-processing and training .(Adhishreya)


## Introduction
- Hubble tuning fork included nearly five categories, the elliptical,bars,irregular lenticular and spiral types. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ,is one of the prominent sky surveys and comprises of deep, multi-color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and created 3-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000 galaxies and more than 120,000 quasars.[13]Galaxy Zoo2 project involved a crowdsourcing effort via a web based platform to classify the galaxies as per a catalogue containing 11 questions and 37 different possible responses in all .[11] eliminated certain questions from the catalogue such as number and tightness of spiral arms. [12].Self supervised technique that works on unlabelled data with certain attributes that can be derived from the images.[11]Deep Learning is said to extract the most relevant features automatically using non-linear transformations.

## Methodology
### Dataset
- [13]Galaxy Zoo2 catalogue was used with datasets derived from Catalog Archieve Server of SDSS(sloan Digital Sky Survey) where the image size was 120x120 px. An approximate of 2,45,609 images were used.[14] images were taken from the Zsolt frei Catalog comprising digital images of nearly 113 from nearby galaxies.[11]Multiple catalogues were referred galaxy zoo catalog2, Zsolt frei Catalog for training and Cheng et al. 2011 for testing the models.[12] first data release of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) (Adhishreya)
### Pre-processing
- [13] Otsu binary transform was performed to separate the background and foreground pixels[14]performs the usual pre-processing steps of resizing, rotating, scaling and centering the images thereby also introducing variability in the data by means of augmentation.[11]. Zooming, rotating, shifting, flipping the images was done as a part of augmentation to prevent overfitting of the models thereby allowing it to generalize well.[15].Coloured images are first converted to grey scale and then to a binary form using Otsu thresholding.(Adhishreya)
