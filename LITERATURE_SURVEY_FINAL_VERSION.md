  The goal of this sub-section is to provide insight into the techniques, architectures and models that we encountered in the papers surveyed in this work. Many algorithms of Machine learning and Deep learning have been used. Machine learning is a field of research that deals with learning algorithms used to parse and learn from data and make predictions based on the same. Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms that create artificial neural networks to make decisions. Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of deep neural networks which are extensively used for image recognition and classification.
