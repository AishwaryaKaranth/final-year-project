## Abstract
- The Universe has billions of galaxies and studying the morphology of the galaxies gives insights into answers to fundamental questions such as the origin of the Universe. We have surveyed 20 papers that have used various machine learning and deep learning approaches to automate the classification of these galaxies to gather insights into the accuracy that is obtained by these approaches. We observe that the deep learning approach yielded a more accurate result compared to the machine learning approach. (Aishwarya)

- Scientists build a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies by classifying them into different categories based on morphological parameters. In this paper, we present a survey of 20 research efforts that employ various machine learning and deep learning techniques for the classification of galaxies based on morphology. The pre-processing methods used on the data, models employed and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics used at each work under study are examined in this paper. (Aditi)

- To study the large-scale structure of the Universe,Morphological classification of galaxies is very important key.The main challenge here is to buid a robust methodology to perform a reliable classification fron the multiple sets of galaxies.Deep learning played a very important role in image Processing and data analysis with very good potential.The hubble sequence is the main research of interest as it allows to classify the galaxies based on their features into three main categories namely Elliptical,Spiral and irregular.Varient of ResNets(Residual Networks),Decision tree algorithm,Random forest regressor is proposed for classification. (Ameena)

- With evolving galaxies and growing galaxy image data it  was impossible for manual sorting. Automated means were then considered and newer algorithms kept on evolving for feature extraction, reduction and ultimately classifying them  Deeplearning techniques is used widely and seem to have replaced the traditional machine learning techinques.We have reviewed 20 research papers specifying various techniques of pre-processing and training .(Adhishreya)


## Introduction
- Hubble tuning fork included nearly five categories, the elliptical,bars,irregular lenticular and spiral types. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ,is one of the prominent sky surveys and comprises of deep, multi-color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and created 3-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000 galaxies and more than 120,000 quasars.[13]Galaxy Zoo2 project involved a crowdsourcing effort via a web based platform to classify the galaxies as per a catalogue containing 11 questions and 37 different possible responses in all .[11] eliminated certain questions from the catalogue such as number and tightness of spiral arms. [12].Self supervised technique that works on unlabelled data with certain attributes that can be derived from the images.[11]Deep Learning is said to extract the most relevant features automatically using non-linear transformations.

- 13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang led to the creation of the universe that we know today, comprising of billions of galaxies of sundry sizes and shapes. Galaxies are gravitationally bound collections of interstellar dust, gas and stars and these mysterious creations are a fundamental topic in cosmology. Galaxies exhibit a plethora of different morphologies and knowledge of the same aids astrophysicists to test existing theories pertaining to the nature of the universe and construct conjectures of their own. Previously, astronomers would use manual techniques for the purpose of classification of galaxies but with the advent of epochal fields like Machine learning and Deep learning, this process has since been automated, which not only greatly reduces the time consumed but also prevents misclassifications and inaccuracies that are inevitable in manual methods. There has been an explosion in the astronomical data available in recent times and the manual analysis of the same is not feasible. Morphological classification of galaxies is the process of categorising galaxies based on their visual shapes. The work surveyed in this paper exhibits different styles of classification. In [1], there was a three-category classification - Elliptical, Spiral and Irregular. In [2], they attempted a five-category classification - spiral, elliptical, round, disk and other. In [3], they tried a three-category classification - elliptical, spiral and irregular initially and then did a 7-category classification based on the Hubble scheme. Another attempt [4] made use of the Galaxy Decision Tree (Willett et al., 2013) in which there are 11 questions and they have to predict the probabilities of 37 answers. In [5], they discuss the importance of Shape descriptors that could be useful indicators in classifying galaxies. The motivation for presenting this survey stems from the need to find the most optimal, efficient and accurate existing method for the classification of galaxies based on morphology.
