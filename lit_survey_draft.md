## Abstract
- The Universe has billions of galaxies and studying the morphology of the galaxies gives insights into answers to fundamental questions such as the origin of the Universe. We have surveyed 20 papers that have used various machine learning and deep learning approaches to automate the classification of these galaxies to gather insights into the accuracy that is obtained by these approaches. We observe that the deep learning approach yielded a more accurate result compared to the machine learning approach. (Aishwarya)

- Scientists build a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies by classifying them into different categories based on morphological parameters. In this paper, we present a survey of 20 research efforts that employ various machine learning and deep learning techniques for the classification of galaxies based on morphology. The pre-processing methods used on the data, models employed and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics used at each work under study are examined in this paper. (Aditi)
